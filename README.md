This is part one of course "Foundations in Deep Learning" in which we started with a book "making your own neural network " by Tariq Rashid. Lecture slides are about the theoratical part of that book while python codes cover the code portion from book. Those codes mainly include defining a class and then making NN for MNIST Data set.

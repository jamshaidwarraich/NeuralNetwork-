Foundations in Deep Learning: Part One
Welcome to Part One of the course "Foundations in Deep Learning"!

Overview
In this section, we delve into the fundamentals of deep learning with a focus on practical implementations. We begin by following the book "Making Your Own Neural Network" by Tariq Rashid as our guide. The lecture slides cover the theoretical aspects outlined in the book, while the accompanying Python codes provide hands-on exercises and implementations.

Content

Book Reference: "Making Your Own Neural Network" by Tariq Rashid serves as the primary resource for this section.
Lecture Slides: The lecture slides provide a theoretical understanding of the concepts discussed in the book.
Python Codes: The Python codes complement the theoretical discussions by covering practical implementations. These codes primarily revolve around defining classes and constructing neural networks for the MNIST dataset.
